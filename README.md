Implementing Core

In Monogame's Game1 Class, next to Game 1() add : base("Insert Name for the Game Window", 
Game Viewport Resolution Width, Game Viewport Resolution Height, Game Window Resolution Width,
Game Window Resolution Height).

In your Game1's Initialize() class, use a ChangeScene() function call with what is your first scene. After that, Game 1 can be ignored from here.
